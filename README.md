Keyboard piano, by Bernard Xie.

This program plays piano sounds when certain keys are pressed, as per the instructions when you first run the program.

I can only guarantee this program to work on Linux machines with mplayer installed.  To install mplayer, you will need to use whatever packaging system your distribution uses, although most distributions should include it.

Please do not change the relative path of the samples folder with respect to the program; the path of the samples are hardcoded, although one only needs to change the $dir variable.

Many thanks go out to the University of Iowa for providing piano samples, modified versions of which are used in this program.
